To help reduce your risk of litigation, we recommend drug testing all employees. We offer two drug screening options: a 5 and a 10-panel option. The 5 panel covers the five most commonly used drugs: amphetamines, cocaine, marijuana, opiates, and phencyclidine. The 10 panel includes barbiturates, benzodiazepines, methadone, methaqualone, and propoxyphene in addition to the above. The 10-panel option is defensible which will protect you in the event of litigation.
